# Crop and Weed Segmentation

This repository contains code for segmenting crops and weeds from images captured by drones in agricultural fields. The task involves labeling each pixel in the image as background, crop, or weed. We provide a dataset comprising training images and corresponding masks (approximately 1400 images), a validation set (around 450 images), and a testing set (around 350 images). Additionally, a data loading class is provided to facilitate dataset handling.
